# Enforcement list

The file `potential_violations.R` takes the output generated by `./data/build_Datadive_csv.py` and finds properties that are potentially in violation of the Ellis Act (i.e., those who have withdrawn but get a new certificate of occupancy within 5 years)

The output of this analysis is stored in `potential_violations.csv`
